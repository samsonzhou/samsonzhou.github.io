	\section{Tips on How to do a Runtime Analysis}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Simple Iterative Algorithms}
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Bound number of iterations
			\item Bound runtime for each iteration, multiply by number of iterations
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Divide and conquer}
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Obtain a recurrence relationship
			\item Confirm that subproblems do not overlap
			\item Apply Master Theorem, or another approach
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Dynamic programming}
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Prove recurrence relationship between subproblems
			\item Confirm problems overlap
			\item Design an implementation that only solves each subproblem once. Given that each problem is only solved once, what is the overall runtime cost?
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Amortized Analysis, for iterative method}
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Aggregate analysis: bound total cost, divide by number of iterations (rather than multiplying number of iterations by maximum iteration cost)
			\item There are two other methods...see practice problems and lecture notes for overview.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Practice Problems}
	
	\begin{questions}
		
		\question What are the three steps of a divide-and-conquer method? Given examples.
		
		\question Describe what steps are needed to prove an amortized runtime analysis using the potential method and the accounting method.
		
		\question What two properties should be satisfied by a problem in order to use a greedy method?
		
		\question What is the strategy we have seen for proving that a greedy method is optimal?
		
		\question Consider the following recurrence:
		\begin{equation*}
			c[i,j] =\begin{cases}
				0 & \text{ if $i = 0$ or $j = 0$} \\
				c[i-1, j-1] + 1 & \text{ if $i,j > 0$ and \textsc{Special Condition} holds}\\
				\max \{ c[i,j-1], c[i-1,j]\} & \text{ if $i,j > 0$ and \textsc{Special Condition} does not hold}.
			\end{cases}
		\end{equation*}
		where $c[i,j]$ is a subproblem of a problem that can be solved via dynamic programming, and is defined for every $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \leq i \leq g$ and $1 \leq j \leq p$. What is the runtime for computing $c[g,p]$ if it takes $O(1)$ time to check \textsc{Special Condition}?
		
		\question Consider the following recurrence relations
		\begin{align*}
			T(n) &= 4T(n/4) + n \\
			T(n) &= 7T(n/2) + n^2 \\
			T(n) &= 3T(n/2) + n^5 \log n\\
			T (n) &= 3T (n/3) + n \log n 
		\end{align*}
		What runtime for this method does the Master Theorem give in each case? Make sure you are aware of situations where the Master Theorem does not apply. You can find other versions of the Master Theorem from other sources, but we will restrict to using the version in our textbook (as presented in class).
		
		\textbf{Reviewing other homework problems is the next best way to prepare!}
