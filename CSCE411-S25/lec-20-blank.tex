	\section{The co-NP class}
	A problem is in co-NP if for every \hide{NO instance } there is a \emph{certificate} (some data) that an algorithm can use to \emph{verify} in polynomial time that it is truly a \hide{ NO instance.} \\ \\
	
	To be clear, we will often use the terms \hide{NO}-certificate and \hide{NO}-verifier. \\ \\
	
	
	\textbf{Example problem} Is $G = (V,E)$ a directed acyclic graph? \\ \\
	
	\vs{2cm}
	
	\textbf{Certificate} \\ \\ %A set of nodes that defines a cycle. \\ \\
	
	\vs{2cm}
	
	\textbf{Verifier} \\ \\ %Check that the set of nodes is a cycle. \\ \\
	
	
	\vfill
	
	\textbf{Conclusion}: Checking whether $G$ is a DAG is \hide{in co-NP. }  \\
	\vs{1cm}
	
	\newpage
	
	\begin{Qu}
		The verifier we showed for the clique problem will return YES if the $k$ nodes are a clique, and will return NO if the $k$ nodes are not a clique. \\
		
		True or false: this means that this algorithm is also a NO-verifier, and so the clique problem is also in co-NP.
		\begin{itemize}
			\aitem True
			\bitem False
		\end{itemize}
		
		
	\end{Qu}
	
	\vfill
	
	\begin{Qu}
		Checking whether $G$ is a DAG in in co-NP. Is it also in NP? 
		\begin{itemize}
			\aitem Yes
			\bitem No
		\end{itemize}
		
	\end{Qu}

	\section{Reductions}
	A reduction is a mapping from one computational problem to another.  \\ 
	
	\textbf{Definition} Let $A$ and $B$ be decision problems. We say that $A$ can be reduced to $B$ if
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For every instance of $A$ we can define a corresponding instance of $B$ such that
		\item All YES instances in $A$ map to YES instances in $B$
		\item All NO instances in $A$ map to NO instances in $B$
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vfill
	
	This is a polynomial-time reduction if this conversion process takes polynomial time. \\
	
	This seems obvious: what's an example of a reduction that is not polynomial-time? \\ \\
	
	\vfill
	
	\newpage
	\subsection{Reduction and complexity}
	
	If $A$ can be reduced to $B$ in polynomial time, we denote this by 
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\hide{A \leq_p B}
	\end{equation*}
	
	This implies that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $A$ is easier\footnote{where easier might mean ``no harder than''} than $B$, or equivalently 
		\item $B$ is at least as hard as $A$ is to solve\\
	\end{itemize} 
	
	\begin{lemma} 
		If $B \in P$ and \hide{$A \leq_p B$}, then \hide{ $A \in P$.}
	\end{lemma}	
	
	\newpage
	
	
	\section{NP-completeness}
	
	\textbf{Definition: } A problem $Q$ is NP-complete if:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $Q \in$ NP
		\item for every problem $B \in \text{NP}$, $B \leq_p Q$. \\
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\textbf{In words:} \\ %a problem is NP-complete if it is NP and you can reduce any problem in NP to it. \\
	
	
	\vs{8cm}
	
	This implies that NP-complete problems are the \emph{hardest} problems in NP. \\
	
	
	Why? Remember that $A \leq_p B$ means $A$ is easier than $B$. \\
	
	In fact, if you only take the second part of the definition, this defines the set of NP-hard problems.

	\section{Views of the computational problem universe}
	There are four different possibilities for the relationship between P, NP, and co-NP.

	There are two possibilities for the relationship between P, NP, and NP-complete.

	\paragraph{A few famous NP-complete problems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Find if a graph has a clique of size at least $k$
		\item Find if a graph has a Hamiltonian cycle
		\item Find if a graph has a simple path with at least $k$ edges
		\item \textbf{Subset sum}: given a set of numbers, find if any subset sums to zero
		\item \textbf{SAT}: Logic problems we will look at in more depth later
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\section{Summary on Reduction and NP-completeness}
	If $A$ can be reduced in polynomial time to $B$, we write $A \leq_p B$. This means that $A$ is no harder than B; a solver for $B$ can be used to solve $A$.\\

	A problem $Q$ is NP-hard if every problem in NP can be reduced to $Q$ in polynomial time. \\
	
	A problem $Q$ is NP-complete if
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is in NP
		\item It is NP-hard\\
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vfill
	
	
	\begin{Qu}
		Assume that $A$ and $B$ are both in NP and $A \leq_p B$. Which of the following statements is false?
		\begin{itemize}
			\aitem If $A \in \text{P}$, then $B \in \text{P}$
			\bitem If $A$ is NP-complete, then $B$ is NP-complete
			\citem If $B \in \text{P}$, then $A \in \text{P}$
			\ditem If $A$ is NP-complete, then $B \leq_p A$

	\section{Why does it matter whether a problem is in P, NP, or is NP-complete?}
	%There are lots of problems we want to know how to solve with a computer. When we encounter a new problem, it's helpful to know how inherently challenging the problem is! \\
	
	A famous book by Garey and Johnson, \emph{Computers and Intractability}, includes some famous cartoons to help us answer this question.\footnote{Garey, Michael R., and David S. Johnson. Computers and intractability. Vol. 174. San Francisco: freeman, 1979. High-resolution versions of the cartoon are available online. }\\
	
	Let's say your boss tells you that because you are a CS major or minor you should be able to find an efficient algorithm for a certain problem at work. You work for weeks without progress. You don't want to tell your boss:
	
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cartoon.png}
	
	Ideally you'd like to be able to say:
	
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cartoon2.png}
	
	But in most situations, proving definitively that this is impossible is unlikely.
	\newpage
	
	If you fail to find an efficient solution to a problem, ask yourself: am I struggling to find a solution simply because this is NP-complete? If you can prove it is, you have a great answer for your boss.\\

	\section{A brief and incomplete history of NP-completeness}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1971: Stephen Cook proves that every problem in NP can be reduced to a problem called \emph{Boolean Satisfiability} (SAT).\\
		
		In modern terminology: SAT is NP-complete.\\
		
		The same results were developed independently by someone named Leonid Levin, so this is now called the \emph{Cook-Levin} Theorem. \\
		\item 1972: Richard Karp publishes a paper \emph{Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems}, showing that SAT can be reduced to 21 other problems. \\
		
		
		\item 1979: Garey and Johnson publish the go-to reference on NP-completeness: \emph{Computers and Intractability}.
