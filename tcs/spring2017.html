		An interesting challenge for the cryptography community is to design authentication protocols that are so simple that a human can execute them
		without relying on a fully trusted computer. We propose several candidate authentication protocols for a setting in which the human user can
		only receive assistance from a semi-trusted computer---a computer that stores information and performs computations correctly
		but does not provide confidentiality. Our schemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges $C_i\in[n]^k$.
		The human user memorizes a random secret mapping $\sigma:[n]\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_d$ and authenticates by computing responses $f(\sigma(C_i))$ to
		a sequence of public challenges where $f:\mathbb{Z}_d^k\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_d$ is a function that is easy for the human to evaluate. We prove
		that any statistical adversary needs to sample $m=\tilde{\Omega}\paren{n^{s(f)}}$ challenge-response pairs to recover $\sigma$, for a security
		parameter $s(f)$ that depends on two key properties of $f$. Our lower bound generalizes recent results of Feldman et al. \cite{feldman2013complexity}
		who proved analogous results for the special case $d=2$. To obtain our results, we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem \cite{o2007analysis}
		to lower bound the {\em statistical dimension } of the distribution over challenge-response pairs induced by $f$ and $\sigma$.
		Our {\em statistical dimension} lower bounds apply to arbitrary functions $f:\mathbb{Z}_d^k\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_d$ (not just to functions that
		are easy for a human to evaluate). As an application, we propose a family of human computable password
		functions $f_{k_1,k_2}$ in which the user needs to perform $2k_1+2k_2+1$ primitive operations (e.g., adding two digits or remembering a
		secret value $\sigma(i)$), and we show that $s(f) = \min\{k_1+1, (k_2+1)/2\}$. For these schemes, we prove that forging passwords is
		equivalent to recovering the secret mapping. Thus, our human computable password schemes can maintain strong security guarantees even after
		an adversary has observed the user login to many different accounts.

		 Streaming for Aibohphobes: Longest Near-Palindrome under Hamming Distance</br>

		Palindromes are strings which read the same backwards and forwards, such as "racecar". 
		Given a metric and an integer d>0, a d-near-palindrome is a string of distance at most d from its reverse. 
		This talk will cover the problem of identifying the longest d-near-palindrome in data streams under the Hamming distance. 
		The problem is relevant to the analysis of DNA databases, and to the task of repairing recursive structures in documents such as XML and JSON.

		We present the first streaming algorithm for the longest d-near-palindrome problem, which returns a d-near-palindrome whose length is within a multiplicative (1+c)-factor of the longest d-near-palindrome, for "small" d. 
		We present additional streaming algorithms which return a d-near-palindrome whose length is within an additive sqrt(n)-factor of the longest d-near-palindrome in one-pass, as well as the longest length d-near-palindrome in two passes.
		Finally, we provide lower bounds for the space necessary to approximate the longest d-near-palindrome.

		Joint work with Elena Grigorescu and Erfan Sadeqi Azer.

		A secret sharing scheme is a mechanism for dividing up a secret among several parties so that unqualified subsets of the 
		parties do not learn any information about the secret, while qualified subsets can recover the secret. Such schemes were 
		introduced by Shamir and Blakley in 1979 and have become an indispensable component in the architecture of secure communication and 
		computation protocols. This talk will address the following foundational aspects of secret sharing and reconstruction: 1. Most secret 
		sharing schemes are based on codes or polynomials. Is the use of linear algebra a necessity in this context or merely a convenience? 
		What are "non-algebraic" schemes good for? What would be the consequences of the non-existence of such schemes? 2. In known secret 
		sharing schemes, the shares are sometimes substantially larger than the secret. Is this loss in information efficiency a necessary 
		price to pay for security? Our methods (from joint works with Siyao Guo, Yuval Ishai, Ilan Komargodski, Emanuele Viola, and Christopher 
		Williamson) expose new connections between secret sharing, approximation theory, and game theory.
