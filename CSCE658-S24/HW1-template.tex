\textbf{Problem 1.} (30 points total)
Suppose we want to generate some randomness. 
A natural way is to use a fair coin to generate the randomness. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item (10 points)
Suppose we have a coin that lands heads with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ and tails with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. 
Describe, with proof, a procedure that uses this coin to generate a random bit that is $0$ with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ and $1$ with probability $\frac{2}{3}$.

\noindent
HINT: The procedure is allowed to fail to generate an output bit, provided that 1) \emph{conditioned} on the event that a bit is output, the output bit is $0$ with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ and $1$ with probability $\frac{2}{3}$, and 2) the probability that a bit is output is positive.  
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Solution:}













\begin{enumerate}

\item (10 points)
Unfortunately, now we only have a coin that lands heads with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ and tails with probability $\frac{2}{3}$. 
Describe, with proof, a procedure that uses this coin to generate a random bit that is $0$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Solution:}











\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item (10 points)
Unfortunately, now we do not even know the probability distribution of our coin. 
Indeed, suppose we now have a coin that lands heads with an unknown probability $p\in(0,1)$. 
Let $k\ge 1$ be an integer. 
Describe, with proof, a procedure that uses this coin to generate a random bit that is $0$ with probability $\frac{1}{k}$ and $1$ with probability $1-\frac{1}{k}$. 
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Problem 2.} (30 points total)
Karger's min-cut algorithm
\begin{enumerate}
\item (10 points)
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an algorithm that prints ``SUCCESS'' with probability $p>0$ each time it is called. 
Show that if we call the algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ independently a total of $m:=\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{p}\right)$ times, then with probability at least $0.99$, it will print ``SUCCESS'' at least one of the $m$ times. 

\noindent
HINT: You may use the fact that $1-x\le e^{-x}$ for all real numbers $x$. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Solution:}











\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item (10 points)
Recall that in class, we showed that Karger's min-cut algorithm succeeds with probability at least $1-\frac{2}{n(n-1)}$. 
Describe with proof, an algorithm that uses Karger's min-cut algorithm as a black-box subroutine, i.e., it cannot change any algorithmic aspects of Karger and finds the min-cut with probability at least $0.99$. 
Your algorithm must use a total of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ edge contractions. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Solution:}















\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item (10 points)
A graph $G$ can have many different min cuts. 
Use the analysis of Karger's min-cut algorithm to show that a connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has at most $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ different min cuts. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Solution:}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newpage\noindent
\textbf{Problem 3.} (30 points total)
Suppose that we improve Karger's min-cut algorithm in the following manner. 
We first run Karger's algorithm and contract edges until there is a graph $G$' that consists of $k$ vertices and super-vertices. 
We then independently run Karger's algorithm $m$ times in parallel on $G'$ and report the minimum of the outputs of the $m$ independent instances. 

\vskip 0.1in\noindent
Show that if $k=\sqrt{n}$ and $m=4n\log n$, then there exists a constant $C$ such that we output the min-cut with probability at least $\frac{C}{n}$. 

\vskip 0.1in\noindent
HINT: First analyze the probability that $G'$ preserves a fixed min-cut of $G$. 

\vskip 0.1in\noindent
NOTE: The goal in Problem 2 was to find the min-cut with probability $0.99$, using $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ edge contractions. 
This improved version of Karger's algorithm uses $\mathcal{O}(n^{2.5})$ edge contractions.

Random variables and probability distributions.

\item (10 points)
Let $X$ and $Y$ be random real-valued variables with probability distributions $p$ and $q$ respectively. 
Suppose that we have $\Ex{X}=\Ex{Y}$. 
Either prove that $p\equiv q$, i.e., $p(x)=q(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, or give a counterexample, with justification.
